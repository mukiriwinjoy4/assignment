        <h1>HTML,CSS and JS Summary</h1>

        <p>
          HTML: is the universal Hyper Text Markup Language for the website.
          HTML lets you format text, add graphics ,create links input forms
          ,frames nad tables and save it all in a text file tha any browser can
          read and display. CSS: Is the cascading style sheet and used to format
          the layout of the webpages. CSS saves a lot of work. with CSS you are
          able to design without affecting the content this is because design is
          different from content. JS: This is used in browsers to build
          interactive web pages in the programmimg language. JS has got two
          types of data;primitive- they are most basic data in the programming
          language since they only contain a single rule. JS is used to reduce
          load on the server and it is able to cut down the time needed for
          compilation and the non-primitive data.
